## What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of programming and computer science, including:

- Algorithmic thinking: Understanding how different sorting algorithms work and their time complexities.
- Pygame: Learning to use Pygame for real-time graphics and user interactions.
- User Interface (UI) design: Creating an intuitive and interactive interface for users.
- Performance analysis: Measuring and analyzing the efficiency of sorting algorithms.
- Version control: Using Git and GitHub for collaborative development and version control.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
3. Run `python main.py` to launch the visualizer.
4. Adjust the array size and speed settings as needed.
5. Select a sorting algorithm to visualize.
6. Watch the algorithm in action and analyze its performance.
